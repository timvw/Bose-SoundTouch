# Favicon Meanings

This directory contains favicons for the Soundcork project in various formats (SVG, PNG, ICO). The icons use Morse code and Braille to represent the initials **S** (Sound) and **T** (Touch).

## Morse Variant (`favicon-morse.*`)
The icon represents the letters **S** and **T** in international Morse code:
- **S**: `...` (three dots), displayed in blue.
- **T**: `-` (one long dash), displayed in yellow.

## Braille Variant (`favicon-braille.*`)
The icon uses the 6-dot Braille grid to represent a stylized combination of the letters **S** and **T**:
- The blue dots represent the base shape.
- The yellow dot (dot 5) serves as an accent for the **T**.
- The light gray dots complete the 2x3 grid for better recognition as Braille.
