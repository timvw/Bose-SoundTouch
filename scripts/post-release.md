Subject: Go Library for Bose SoundTouch Speakers - 100% API Coverage

Hi [Name],

I recently released a comprehensive Go library for controlling Bose SoundTouch speakers that might interest your audience:

🎯 Key highlights:
- 100% API coverage with real hardware validation
- Production-ready patterns and extensive documentation
- WebSocket events for real-time control
- Cross-platform CLI tool

The project demonstrates several interesting engineering challenges:
- IoT device discovery and control
- WebSocket event handling with auto-reconnect
- XML parsing and validation for legacy APIs
- Cross-platform binary distribution

Would this be interesting for [blog/podcast]? I'd be happy to discuss the technical details and lessons learned.

GitHub: https://github.com/gesellix/bose-soundtouch

Best regards,
[Your name]
```
