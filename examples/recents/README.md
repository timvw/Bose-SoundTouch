# Recents Endpoint Example

This example demonstrates how to use the `/recents` endpoint to retrieve and analyze recently played content from your SoundTouch device.

## What is the Recents Endpoint?

The recents endpoint provides access to the device's recently played content history, including:

- **Recently played tracks** from various music services
- **Radio stations** that were recently listened to
- **Playlists and albums** that were recently accessed
- **Local music** files that were recently played
- **Metadata** including play timestamps, content types, and source information
- **Filtering capabilities** by source type and content type

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage - show last 10 items
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100

# Show detailed information for all items
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -detailed -limit 0

# Filter by source (show only Spotify items)
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -source SPOTIFY

# Filter by content type (show only tracks)
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -type track

# Show statistics only
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -stats

# Combined filters with custom limit
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -source LOCAL_MUSIC -type track -limit 5 -detailed
```

## Command Line Options

- `-host` - **Required**: SoundTouch device IP address
- `-detailed` - Show detailed information for each item (default: false)
- `-limit` - Maximum number of items to display, 0 for all (default: 10)
- `-source` - Filter by source (SPOTIFY, LOCAL_MUSIC, TUNEIN, etc.)
- `-type` - Filter by content type (track, station, playlist, album, presetable)
- `-stats` - Show statistics only (default: false)
- `-timeout` - Request timeout duration (default: 10s)

## Use Cases

### 1. Recently Played Music Discovery

# Find recently played Spotify tracks
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -source SPOTIFY -type track -detailed
```

### 2. Radio Station History
```bash
# See what radio stations were recently played
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -type station -detailed
```

### 3. Content Analytics
```bash
# Get detailed listening statistics
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -stats
```

### 4. Preset Candidates
```bash
# Find content that can be saved as presets
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -type presetable -limit 6
```

### 5. Local vs Streaming Analysis
```bash
# Compare local vs streaming content usage
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -stats
```

## API Integration

The example demonstrates several key API patterns:

### Basic Retrieval
```go
response, err := client.GetRecents()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

if response.IsEmpty() {
    fmt.Println("No recent items found")
    return
}
```

### Filtering by Source
```go
spotifyItems := response.GetSpotifyItems()
localItems := response.GetLocalMusicItems()
tuneInItems := response.GetTuneInItems()
```

### Filtering by Type
```go
tracks := response.GetTracks()
stations := response.GetStations()
presetableItems := response.GetPresetableItems()
```

### Item Analysis
```go
for _, item := range response.Items {
    if item.IsSpotifyContent() {
        fmt.Printf("Spotify track: %s\n", item.GetDisplayName())
    }
    
    if item.IsPresetable() {
        fmt.Printf("Can be saved as preset: %s\n", item.GetDisplayName())
    }
    
    if item.HasArtwork() {
        fmt.Printf("Artwork URL: %s\n", item.GetArtwork())
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

The example includes comprehensive error handling:

```bash
# Test with invalid host
go run main.go -host 192.168.255.255
# Output: Failed to get recent items: connection timeout

# Test with unknown source
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -source UNKNOWN
# Output: 📭 No items found for source: UNKNOWN
#         💡 Available sources: SPOTIFY, LOCAL_MUSIC, TUNEIN

# Test with unknown type
go run main.go -host 192.168.1.100 -type unknown
# Output: ❌ Unknown type filter: unknown
#         💡 Available types: track, station, playlist, album, presetable
```

## Performance Considerations

- The recents endpoint typically returns up to 20-50 items depending on device configuration
- Response times are usually under 500ms for typical recent lists
- Use filtering to reduce processing time for large recent lists
- Consider caching results if calling frequently in applications

## Integration with Other Examples

This recents data is useful for:
- [Preset Management](../preset-management/) - Finding presetable content to save
- [Source Selection](../source-selection/) - Understanding usage patterns
- [Navigation](../navigation/) - Quickly accessing recently played content
